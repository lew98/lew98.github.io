\section{Definitions}
\label{sec:definitions}

Let \( A \) be a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set}{partially ordered set}.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:sup_inf_max_min}
    Suppose we have a subset \( E \subseteq A \) and some \( y \in A \) which satisfies the following two conditions:
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item \( y \) is an upper bound of \( E \), i.e.\ for all \( x \in E \), \( x \leq y \);
        
        \item \( y \) is the least upper bound of \( E \), i.e.\ if \( z \in A \) is an upper bound of \( E \) then \( y \leq z \), or equivalently, if \( z \in A \) is such that \( y \not\leq z \) (which is to say \( z < y \) or \( z \) is incomparable with \( y \)), then \( z \) is not an upper bound of \( E \).
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \noindent Then \( y \) is known as a \textbf{supremum} or \textbf{least upper bound} of \( E \). If instead \( y \) satisfies condition (i), i.e.\ \( y \) is an upper bound of \( E \), and \( y \in E \), then \( y \) is known as a \textbf{maximum} of \( E \). Similarly, suppose \( y \) satisfies the following two conditions:
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*), start = 3]
        \item \( y \) is a lower bound of \( E \), i.e.\ for all \( x \in E \), \( y \leq x \);
        
        \item \( y \) is the greatest lower bound of \( E \), i.e.\ if \( z \in A \) is a lower bound of \( E \) then \( z \leq y \), or equivalently, if \( z \in A \) is such that \( z \not\leq y \) (which is to say \( y < z \) or \( z \) is incomparable with \( y \)), then \( z \) is not a lower bound of \( E \).
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \noindent Then \( y \) is known as an \textbf{infimum} or \textbf{greatest lower bound} of \( E \). If instead \( y \) satisfies condition (iii), i.e.\ \( y \) is a lower bound of \( E \), and \( y \in E \), then \( y \) is known as a \textbf{minimum} of \( E \).
\end{definition}

In fact, the supremum of a subset \( E \) is unique. If \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) both satisfy conditions (i) and (ii) in \Cref{def:sup_inf_max_min}, then by condition (ii) we must have both \( y_1 \leq y_2 \) and \( y_2 \leq y_1 \); it follows that \( y_1 = y_2 \). Similar reasoning shows that the infimum of a subset is also unique. For this reason, we are justified in saying \textit{the} supremum of \( E \) and \textit{the} infimum of \( E \).

It is straightforward to see that if \( E \) has a maximum \( M \), then \( \sup E = M \), and if \( E \) has a minimum \( m \), then \( \inf E = m \). By the previous paragraph, it follows that the maximum and minimum of a set are unique. However, \( E \) may have a supremum without having a maximum, and may have an infimum without having a minimum. For example, if \( A = \mathbb{R} \) and \( E = (0, 1) \), then one can verify that \( \sup E = 1 \) and \( \inf E = 0 \), but \( E \) has no minimum or maximum element.

A subset need not have a supremum or an infimum. For example, if \( A = E = \mathbb{Q} \), then \( E \) does not have a supremum or an infimum; indeed, \( E \) has no upper or lower bounds. Even if \( E \) does have upper and lower bounds, the supremum and infimum of \( E \) need not exist; see \href{https://lew98.github.io/Mathematics/Q_does_not_have_the_least_upper_bound_property.pdf}{here} for a counterexample.

What if we take \( E \) to be the empty set in \Cref{def:sup_inf_max_min}? Note that any \( a \in A \) is an upper bound of the empty set, since the statement
\[
    \forall x \in \emptyset \quad x \leq a
\]
is vacuously true. Hence if \( y \in A \) is to be the supremum of the empty set, then \( y \) must satisfy \( y \leq a \) for all \( a \in A \), i.e.\ \( y \) must be the minimum of \( A \). It follows that the empty set has a supremum if and only if \( A \) has a minimum, and if they both exist then \( \sup \emptyset = \min A \). A similar discussion shows that the empty set has an infimum if and only if \( A \) has a maximum, and if they both exist then \( \inf \emptyset = \max A \).

\begin{definition}
\label{def:lub_glb_properties}
    If any subset \( E \subseteq A \) which is non-empty and bounded above admits a supremum in \( A \), then \( A \) is said to have the \textbf{least-upper-bound property}, or to be \textbf{Dedekind complete}. If any subset \( E \subseteq A \) which is non-empty and bounded below admits an infimum in \( A \), then \( A \) is said to have the \textbf{greatest-lower-bound property}.
\end{definition}

For example, the real numbers have the least-upper-bound property. This can be taken as an axiom (the Axiom of Completeness), or it can be shown as a theorem while constructing the real numbers from the rational numbers; one approach to do this is via \href{https://lew98.github.io/Mathematics/Construction_of_R_from_Q_via_Dedekind_cuts.pdf}{Dedekind cuts}. On the other hand, the \href{https://lew98.github.io/Mathematics/Q_does_not_have_the_least_upper_bound_property.pdf}{rational numbers do not have the least-upper-bound property}.

Regarding these properties, we have the following proposition.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:lub_glb_property_equivalence}
    \( A \) has the least-upper-bound property if and only if \( A \) has the greatest-lower-bound property.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    We shall only show that if \( A \) has the least-upper-bound property, then \( A \) has the greatest-lower-bound property; the converse implication is proved similarly. Suppose therefore that \( A \) has the least-upper-bound property and let \( E \subseteq A \) be non-empty and bounded below. Define
    \[
        B = \{ l \in A : l \text{ is a lower bound of } E \}.
    \]
    Then \( B \) is non-empty since \( E \) is bounded below, and \( B \) is bounded above by any \( x \in E \); there exists at least one such \( x \) since \( E \) is non-empty. Since \( A \) has the least-upper-bound property, it follows that \( \sup B \) exists in \( A \). We claim that \( \inf E = \sup B \). To see this, we need to show two things.
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item \( \sup B \) is a lower bound of \( E \). Seeking a contradiction, suppose this is not the case, i.e.\ suppose there exists \( x \in E \) with \( \sup B \not\leq x \). Then \( x \) cannot be an upper bound of \( B \), so there must exist some \( l \in B \) such that \( l \not\leq x \); this is a contradiction since \( l \) is a lower bound of \( E \).

        \item \( \sup B \) is the greatest lower bound of \( E \). Suppose \( y \in A \) is a lower bound of \( E \). Then \( y \) belongs to \( B \), so \( y \leq \sup B \).
    \end{enumerate}

    We have now shown that any \( E \subseteq A \) which is non-empty and bounded below admits an infimum in \( A \), i.e.\ that \( A \) has the greatest-lower-bound property.
\end{proof}

\section{Partially ordered sets}
\label{sec:partially_ordered_sets}

Let \( A \) be a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set}{partially ordered set}.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:subset_implies_sup/inf_order}
    Suppose we have subsets \( E \subseteq G \subseteq A \).
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item If \( \sup E \) and \( \sup G \) both exist, then \( \sup E \leq \sup G \).
        
        \item If \( \inf E \) and \( \inf G \) both exist, then \( \inf G \leq \inf E \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item It is straightforward to see that any upper bound of \( G \) is also an upper bound of \( E \). It follows that \( \sup G \) is an upper bound of \( E \) and hence that \( \sup E \leq \sup G \).

        \item The proof is easily adapted from part (i). \qedhere
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:sup_inf_unions_partial_order}
    Suppose we have subsets \( \{ E_i \subseteq A : i \in I \} \) for some indexing set \( I \).
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item If \( \sup E_i \) exists in \( A \) for each \( i \in I \) and \( \sup \{ \sup E_i : i \in I \} \) also exists in \( A \), then
        \[
            \textstyle{\sup \left( \bigcup_{i \in I} E_i \right) = \sup \{ \sup E_i : i \in I \}.}
        \]

        \item If \( \inf E_i \) exists in \( A \) for each \( i \in I \) and \( \inf \{ \inf E_i : i \in I \} \) also exists in \( A \), then
        \[
            \textstyle{\inf \left( \bigcup_{i \in I} E_i \right) = \inf \{ \inf E_i : i \in I \}.}
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item Let \( s = \sup \{ \sup E_i : i \in I \} \) and \( E' = \bigcup_{i \in I} E_i \). Suppose \( x \in E' \), i.e.\ there exists some \( j \in I \) such that \( x \in E_j \). Then \( x \leq \sup E_j \leq s \); it follows that \( s \) is an upper bound of \( E' \). Suppose that \( y \in A \)  is such that \( s \not\leq y \). Then \( y \) cannot be an upper bound of \( \{ \sup E_i : i \in I \} \), so there must exist some \( j \in I \) such that \( \sup E_j \not\leq y \), which implies that \( y \) cannot be an upper bound of \( E_j \), i.e.\ there exists some \( x \in E_j \) such that \( x \not\leq y \). Since this \( x \) also belongs to \( E' \), it follows that \( y \) cannot be an upper bound of \( E' \). We may conclude that \( \sup E' = s \).

        \item The proof is easily adapted from part (i). \qedhere
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

Even if \( \sup E_i \) exists for each \( i \in I \), it may not be the case that \( \sup \{ \sup E_i : i \in I \} \) exists. For example, if \( A = \mathbb{R}, I = \mathbb{N}, \) and \( E_i = [0, i] \), then \( \sup E_i = i \) but the set \( \{ \sup E_i : i \in I \} = \mathbb{N} \) has no supremum in \( \mathbb{R} \). A similar discussion holds for infima.

\section{Totally ordered sets}
\label{sec:totally_ordered_sets}

Let \( A \) be a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order}{totally ordered set}. Note that since any two elements of a totally ordered set are comparable, we need not consider the possibility that ``\( z \) is incomparable with \( y \)" in parts (ii) and (iv) of \Cref{def:sup_inf_max_min}.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:finite_set_has_min_max_total_order}
    Any finite non-empty subset \( E \subseteq A \) has a minimum and maximum element.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose \( E \) has \( n \) elements, where \( n \) is a positive integer. We shall prove the proposition by induction on \( n \). For the base case, \( n = 1 \), we have \( E = \{ x \} \) for some \( x \in A \). Then \( x = \min E = \max E \). Suppose that the result is true for some \( n \), i.e.\ any \( n \) element set has a minimum and a maximum, and suppose that \( E \) has \( n + 1 \) elements. Pick any \( y \in E \) and set \( E' = E \setminus \{ y \} \). Then \( E' \) has \( n \) elements and so by assumption \( m = \min E' \) and \( M = \max E' \) both exist. There are now three cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( y < m \). Then \( y = \min E \) and \( M = \max E \).

        \item \( M < y \). Then \( m = \min E \) and \( y = \max E \).

        \item \( m < y < M \). Then \( m = \min E \) and \( M = \max E \).
    \end{itemize}

    These cases are exclusive and exhaustive since the order on \( A \) is total. This completes the induction step and hence the result is true for any positive integer \( n \).
\end{proof}

If \( E \) is an infinite set, then \( E \) may have a minimum element, a maximum element, both, or neither. For example, consider the set \( \mathbb{Q}' = \mathbb{Q} \cup \{ -\infty, \infty \} \); the rational numbers with the formal symbols \( -\infty \) and \( \infty \) adjoined. We take the usual order on \( \mathbb{Q} \) and declare that \( -\infty \) is strictly less than any other element of \( \mathbb{Q}' \) and that \( \infty \) is strictly greater than any other element of \( \mathbb{Q}' \). One can verify that this defines a total order on \( \mathbb{Q}' \).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider \( E = \{ -\infty \} \cup \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}' \). Then \( \min E = -\infty \) but \( E \) has no maximum element. However, \( \sup E = \infty \).

    \item Similarly, consider \( E = \mathbb{Q} \cup \{ \infty \} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}' \). Then \( \max E = \infty \) but \( E \) has no minimum element. However, \( \inf E = -\infty \).

    \item \( \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}' \) has no minimum or maximum element, but \( \inf \mathbb{Q} = -\infty \) and \( \sup \mathbb{Q} = \infty \).

    \item \( \mathbb{Q}' \) itself has a minimum and a maximum element: \( \min \mathbb{Q}' = -\infty \) and \( \max \mathbb{Q}' = \infty \).
\end{itemize}
 
It is straightforward to combine \Cref{prop:sup_inf_unions_partial_order} and \Cref{prop:finite_set_has_min_max_total_order} to obtain the following proposition.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:sup_inf_unions_total_order}
    Suppose we have subsets \( E_1, \ldots, E_n \subseteq A \).
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item If \( \sup E_1, \ldots, \sup E_n \) all exist in \( A \), then
        \[
            \textstyle{\sup \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} E_i \right) = \max \{ \sup E_1, \ldots, \sup E_n \}}.
        \]

        \item If \( \inf E_1, \ldots, \inf E_n \) all exist in \( A \), then
        \[
            \textstyle{\inf \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} E_i \right) = \min \{ \inf E_1, \ldots, \inf E_n \}}.
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:sup/inf_strictly_comparable_implies_bounds}
    Suppose we have subsets \( E, G \subseteq A \).
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item If \( \sup E \) and \( \sup G \) both exist and \( \sup E < \sup G \), then there exists \( y \in G \) such that \( y \) is an upper bound of \( E \).

        \item If \( \inf E \) and \( \inf G \) both exist and \( \inf G < \inf E \), then there exists \( y \in G \) such that \( y \) is a lower bound of \( E \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item \( \sup E \) is not an upper bound of \( G \), so there exists \( y \in G \) such that \( \sup E < y \). Then for any \( x \in E \), we have \( x \leq \sup E < y \), i.e.\ \( y \) is an upper bound of \( E \).

        \item The proof is easily adapted from part (i). \qedhere
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

Note that an analogous statement to part (i) for partially ordered sets is not necessarily true, i.e.\ if \( A \) is a partially ordered set, the statement

\vspace{6px}
\begin{adjustwidth}{16px}{16px}
    ``If \( \sup E \) and \( \sup G \) both exist and \( \sup G \not\leq \sup E \), then there exists \( y \in G \) such that \( y \) is an upper bound of \( E \)."
\end{adjustwidth}
\vspace{6px}

\noindent is false in general. For a counterexample, consider the partial order which has the following \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram}{Hasse diagram}.

\[
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep = tiny]
    & s & & & & t & \\
    a \arrow[ru, no head] & & b \arrow[lu, no head] & & c \arrow[ru, no head] & & d \arrow[lu, no head]
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Let \( E = \{ a, b \} \) and \( G = \{ c, d \} \). Then \( \sup E = s, \sup G = t, t \not\leq s, \) but neither \( c \) nor \( d \) are upper bounds of \( E \).


\section{Ordered fields}
\label{sec:ordered_fields}

Let \( F \) be an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field}{ordered field} (for example, \( \mathbb{Q} \) and \( \mathbb{R} \) are ordered fields).

\begin{proposition}[Approximation property for suprema and infima]
\label{prop:approximation_property}
    Suppose that \( u \in F \) is an upper bound and \( l \in F \) is a lower bound of a subset \( E \subseteq F \).

    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item \( u = \sup E \) if and only if for all \( \varepsilon > 0 \) there exists an \( x \in E \) such that \( u - \varepsilon < x \leq u \).

        \item \( l = \inf E \) if and only if for all \( \varepsilon > 0 \) there exists an \( x \in E \) such that \( l \leq x < l + \varepsilon \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item We will prove the forward implication by considering the contrapositive statement. Assume therefore that there exists an \( \varepsilon > 0 \) such that for all \( x \in E \), we have \( x \leq u - \varepsilon \). Then \( u - \varepsilon \) is an upper bound of \( E \) and \( u - \varepsilon < u \). It follows that \( u \) is not the least upper bound of \( E \), i.e.\ \( u \neq \sup E \).

        For the reverse implication, suppose that \( z \in F \) is such that \( z < u \). Then by assumption there exists an \( x \in E \) such that \( u - (u - z) = z < x \). It follows that \( z \) cannot be an upper bound of \( E \) and we may conclude that \( u = \sup E \).

        \item The proof is analogous to part (i). \qedhere
    \end{enumerate}

\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:add_mult_constant}
    For \( E \subseteq F \) and \( c \in F \), define
    \[
        E + c = \{ x + c : x \in E \} \quad \text{and} \quad cE = \{ cx : x \in E \}.
    \]

    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item If \( \sup E \) exists, then \( \sup (E + c) = \sup E + c \).
        
        \item If \( \inf E \) exists, then \( \inf (E + c) = \inf E + c \).
        
        \item If \( \sup E \) exists and \( c \geq 0 \), then \( \sup (cE) = c \cdot \sup E \).
        
        \item If \( \inf E \) exists and \( c \geq 0 \), then \( \inf (cE) = c \cdot \inf E \).
        
        \item If \( \inf E \) exists and \( c < 0 \), then \( \sup (cE) = c \cdot \inf E \).

        \item If \( \sup E \) exists and \( c < 0 \), then \( \inf (cE) = c \cdot \sup E \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    The proofs of each part of this proposition are similar and mostly involve applying the defining properties of an ordered field.

    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item For any \( x \in E \), we have
        \[
            x \leq \sup E \iff x + c \leq \sup E + c,
        \]
        so that \( \sup E + c \) is an upper bound of \( E + c \). Suppose \( y \in F \) is such that \( y < \sup E + c \). Then \( y - c < \sup E \), so \( y - c \) cannot be an upper bound of \( E \), i.e.\ there exists \( x \in E \) such that \( y - c < x \iff y < x + c \). It follows that \( y \) cannot be an upper bound of \( E + c \) and we may conclude that \( \sup (E + c) = \sup E + c \).

        \item The proof is easily adapted from part (i).

        \item If \( c = 0 \) then the result is clear. Suppose therefore that \( c > 0 \). For any \( x \in E \), we have
        \[
            x \leq \sup E \iff cx \leq c \cdot \sup E,
        \]
        so that \( c \cdot \sup E \) is an upper bound of \( cE \). Suppose \( y \in F \) is such that \( y < c \cdot \sup E \). Then \( c^{-1} y < \sup E \), so \( c^{-1} y \) cannot be an upper bound of \( E \), i.e.\ there exists \( x \in E \) such that \( c^{-1} y < x \iff y < cx \). It follows that \( y \) cannot be an upper bound of \( cE \) and we may conclude that \( \sup (cE) = c \cdot \sup E \).

        \item The proof is easily adapted from part (iii).

        \item For any \( x \in E \), we have
        \[
            \inf E \leq x \iff cx \leq c \cdot \inf E,
        \]
        so that \( c \cdot \inf E \) is an upper bound of \( cE \). Suppose \( y \in F \) is such that \( y < c \cdot \inf E \). Then \( \inf E < c^{-1} y \), so \( c^{-1} y \) cannot be a lower bound of \( E \), i.e.\ there exists \( x \in E \) such that \( x < c^{-1} y \iff y < cx \). It follows that \( y \) cannot be an upper bound of \( cE \) and we may conclude that \( \sup (cE) = c \cdot \inf E \).

        \item The proof is easily adapted from part (v). \qedhere
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

Regarding part (v) of this proposition, even if \( \inf E \) exists, it may not be the case that \( \inf (cE) \) exists. For example, if \( F = \mathbb{R} \), \( E = (0, \infty) \), and \( c = -1 \), then \( \inf E = 0 \) but \( cE = (-\infty, 0) \), which does not have an infimum in \( \mathbb{R} \). A similar discussion holds for part (vi) and suprema.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:add_sets}
    For \( E, G \subseteq F \), define
    \[
        E + G = \{ x + y : x \in E, y \in G \}. 
    \]
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item If \( \sup E \) and \( \sup G \) both exist, then \( \sup(E + G) = \sup E + \sup G \).

        \item If \( \inf E \) and \( \inf G \) both exist, then \( \inf(E + G) = \inf E + \inf G \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item Let \( s = \sup E \) and \( t = \sup G \). It is straightforward to see that \( s + t \) is an upper bound of \( E + G \). Suppose \( z \in F \) is such that \( z < s + t \). Then \( z - t < s \), so \( z - t \) cannot be an upper bound of \( E \), i.e.\ there exists \( x \in E \) such that \( z - t < x \). This gives \( z - x < t \), so that \( z - x \) cannot be an upper bound of \( G \), i.e.\ there exists \( y \in G \) such that \( z - x < y \), which gives \( z < x + y \). It follows that \( z \) cannot be an upper bound of \( E + G \) and we may conclude that \( \sup(E + G) = s + t = \sup E + \sup G \).

        \item The proof is analogous to part (i). \qedhere
